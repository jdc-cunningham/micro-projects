#### Build thoughts

Oh dang... not bad. I was scared at first about this webpack stuff but I just ran the `npm install` commands here https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader#readme and then made a `main.scss` file and copied the `@import` lines to pull from `node_modules` and it works. I didn't have to actually do any manual webpack config stuff, cool. I still think this calendar is overkill for my needs. I just don't want to mess around with making a calendar from scratch, worrying about filling in days from which month based on grid design, etc...

And there you go, a full working calendar, cool.
