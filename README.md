# micro projects
Random stuff that don't need individual repos, most likely unrelated to each other

## Websites
[Local Site Placeholder](https://github.com/jdc-cunningham/micro-projects/tree/master/local-site-placeholder)

This is a basic full-photo background randomizer for a local site interceptor eg. editing your computer hosts file to point somesite.com to this website. As part of means to curb habits.

## Personal utility apps
[Bill calendar](https://github.com/jdc-cunningham/micro-projects/tree/master/finance-calendar)

Just an overview of how much money you need in a particular week of a month.

[Money State](https://github.com/jdc-cunningham/micro-projects/tree/master/money-state)

This is another finance-related app in progress. I have a basic design in mind. The main point is to have peace of mind knowing you're not financially F'd seeing your local/maxima eg. student debt chains.
