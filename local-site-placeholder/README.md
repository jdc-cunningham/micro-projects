## About
This expects some kind of web server already installed eg. Apache

## Purpose
This is a website placeholder when you replace domains in your local hosts file eg. website.com goes to your inbound address(the server hosting this file)
I'm using it to block social media sites, I know you could just "install an extesion" or something but with this I can also modify it
Like an overlay of goal reminders
