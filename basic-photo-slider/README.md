### Basic Photo Slider
This is not a fancy slide transition, automatic, dynamic, etc, etc... this is literally a manually specified array of images and you hit arrows(left/right) to cycle images. This is for me intended on local network

### Note
Take note of the extension, this slider is super basic so it only supports one file type and you have to set it in two places: the html inline background style for the first load for `id="photo-display"` and then the `fileExt` constant.
