### About
This is just a basic down-detector, makes a request to some site once or a couple times a day.
If it fails to respond eg. 200/content mismatch(Cloudflare), sends text message to me.
I have an SMS thing running already(using Twilio)
I think this will use Python or maybe PHP... or Node... I have those running on the backend on different Pis in my apt
